		<p>Ms. Scarlett becomes involved in a murder mystery when someone is killed at a dinner party in a fancy mansion! There are five other suspects in the case: Ms. Peacock, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard, Ms. White, and Mr. Green. Which of these six people commited the crime and what sort of weapon did they use? Ms. Scarlet is a very glamorous and mysterious lady (plus, I always have good luck when I choose her as a character while playing the board game :)).</p>

		<p>The character Ms. Scarlett originated from the board game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo"><i>Clue</i></a>.</p>
